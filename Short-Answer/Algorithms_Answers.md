a. O(n) -> this method depends on n input as n get larger the number of loops increases. the operation is 0(n)

b. O(n^3) - > this loop has 3 nested  O(n) therefore n*n*n will give this loop an O(n^3)

c. O(n) - -> as n increases the number of operation increases that's why I believe this function is  O(n)
