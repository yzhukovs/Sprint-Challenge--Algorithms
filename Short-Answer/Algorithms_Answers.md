##Exercise I

a. O(n) -> this method depends on n input as n get larger the number of loops increases. the operation is 0(n)

b. O(n^3) - > this loop has 3 nested  O(n) therefore n*n*n will give this loop an O(n^3)

c. O(n) - -> as n increases the number of operation increases that's why I believe this function is  O(n)



##Exercise II

I think the best strategy that will result in the least amount of wasted egss will be the binary search, _O(log n)_. First we will devide the number of floors in half and then we will throw an egg, if the egg breaks we eliminate the above floors and will move down half again. If it doesn't break, we eliminate the below floors and we will move up half again. I think it's the best strategy to find that value of _f_.
